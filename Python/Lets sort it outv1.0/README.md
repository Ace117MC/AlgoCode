## Sorting Algorithms in Python
Feature to run bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort algorithms on a list of numbers in Python. 

## Sorting Algorithm Options
- Bubble Sort: sort elements in a list by swapping each pair of adjacent numbers if the left one is greater than the right one. Repeat until sorted.
- Insertion Sort: sort elements in a list by inserting each element in its correct location by swapping to the left if the number is less than the number to the left. The array becomes split with the lower part being sorted and the upper part being unsorted.
- Selection Sort: sort elements in a list by inserting elements into their correct location at the beginning of the list. To begin, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part contains all the elements.

## How to Run
$ sort.py
- You will be prompted to enter a sorting algorithm type (bubble, insertion, selection). 
- Then you will be prompted to enter a list of numbers on a single line with spaces separating the numbers (ex: 5 3 8 4 6). 
- Then the algorithm will run and output the sorted list.
