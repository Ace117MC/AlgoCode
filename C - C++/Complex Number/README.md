# Operations on 2 Complex Numbers in C++
A = a + ib, A is a complex number where a = real part and b = imaginary part

## Program performs the following  operations with two complex numbers A, B:

* addition =        A + B or (a+bi) + (c+di)
* subtraction =     A- B or (a+bi) - (c+di)
* multiplication =  A * B or (a+bi) * (c+di)
* division =        A / B or (a+bi) / (c+di)
* mod(A) =          ((a+bi)*(a-bi))^0.5
* mod(B) =          ((c+di)*(c-di))^0.5

## Directions : 
After executing the prgram provide the values of a and b in first line and values of c and d in second line.

## Example
First input will be 1st number with real and imaginary part similarly with second number.

<b>Input:</b>
2 1
5 6

<b>Output:</b>
7 + 7i
-3 - 5i
4 + 17i
0.26-0.11i
2.24
7.81
